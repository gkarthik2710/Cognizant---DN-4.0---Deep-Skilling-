Exercise 3: Stored Procedures

Scenario 1: ProcessMonthlyInterest

The ProcessMonthlyInterest procedure is created to apply monthly interest to all savings accounts in the database. 
It adds 1% of the current balance to each account's balance using an UPDATE statement. This operation simulates the 
monthly interest accumulation in a real-world banking system. The logic is applied to all records in the SavingsAccounts 
table and committed at the end to save the changes permanently.


Scenario 2: UpdateEmployeeBonus

The UpdateEmployeeBonus procedure is designed to implement a flexible bonus system for employees. It accepts two input 
parameters: the department name and the bonus percentage. The procedure updates the salaries of all employees in the 
specified department by adding the bonus amount, which is calculated as a percentage of their current salary. This 
promotes performance-based incentives and departmental salary adjustments.


Scenario 3: TransferFunds

The TransferFunds procedure allows customers to transfer funds between their accounts. It takes three input parameters: 
source account ID, destination account ID, and the transfer amount. Before performing the transfer, it checks whether 
the source account has sufficient balance. If the balance is adequate, the amount is deducted from the source account 
and added to the destination account. This ensures transactional integrity and avoids overdrawing an account.
